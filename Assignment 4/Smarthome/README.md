#Assignment 4 Smart Home

- We implemented the Smarthome App and tryed to make it as intuitive as possible.
- The command pattern design is the only design we used.

**How to use the app:**

- To choose a machine, type the first letter of the machinename. It must be uppercase. e.g. D for dishwasher
- To choose a command of a machine, type the button number. e.g. 1 for [1][ON]
- To choose a program for example a oven, type in the program name eg. Grill for [Grill]

- Everytime you are in the "SMARTHOME APP" you can exit the app by typing "e"

**Class Diagram**
![Smarthome Class Diagram](smarthome_cd.format)

In the class diagram, we did not put every Command class in the UML because that would be unnecessary and very big.
Instead we put a container MachineCommandx which should represent all Command classes.
However, we put there all oven command classes to show how each machine command should look like.
